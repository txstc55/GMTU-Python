# GMTU â€” Privacy Policy

## This is the privacy document for the ios app GMTU

## Effective Date: 05/07/2025

GMTU does not collect, store, or share any personal information.

The app does not collect user data for analytics, advertising, or profiling purposes.

The app does not use any tracking technologies.

The app does not share data with third parties.

The app does not collect or store crash reports.

The app does not collect personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or location data.

### Push Notifications

GMTU uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver push notifications to your device.

In order to receive push notifications, the app generates an fcm token. This token identifies your device for notification purposes only and is not linked to your personal identity.

The app does not automatically transmit this token to any server.
Users may choose to copy and use their device token with the gmtu python package to send notifications to their device via Firebase.

The token is handled locally on the device and is only shared externally if the user decides to do so.

For more information on Firebase Cloud Messaging, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Data Security

All app features operate entirely on the user's device.

To deliver message, user will need to use the python frontend.

Device tokens used for notifications are managed securely and are not shared with any third parties beyond Firebase (as required to deliver push notifications).
